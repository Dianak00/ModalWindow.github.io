# ModalWindow.github.io
The purpose: Create a web page (HTML), containing 3 visible buttons on the page and a 'hidden' modal.
Each click on any button must make the modal visible.
The title of the modal should change depending on which button was pressed:
In HTML we should only have 1 modal, not 3.
